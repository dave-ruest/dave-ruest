# 🇨🇦📱 Dave Ruest 
Hi, I'm Dave, a senior iOS developer. I love coding beautiful apps. 

#👷 Current Projects
I'm currently adding a few more features to Bookmind. It's a book tracking app I'm writing for my wife to track her reading history and for me to track my book collection. 

# ⏰ Future Projects
I have a few projects in mind, but if you have a beautiful spec for an app, I could probably be convinced to help.
