# 📱 Dave Ruest 🇨🇦 
Hi! I'm Dave, a senior iOS developer. I love building beautiful apps. 

# 👷 Current Projects
I'm currently adding a few more features to Bookmind. It's a book tracking app: track your reading history or book collection or both. My latest public repository, AdaptiveLayout, hints at my next feature. AdaptiveLayout is a swift package with a macro to help a universal app provide different layouts on iPhone, iPad and mac. 

# ⏰ Future Projects
I have a few projects in mind, but if you have a beautiful spec for an app, I could probably be convinced to help.
